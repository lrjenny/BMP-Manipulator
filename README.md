# BMP-Manipulator
A project for a UW course that accepts two BMP files and produces a double exposure and a checkerboard of the two.

The checkerboard produces an 8x8 grid pattern using chunks of each image.
the double exposure produces an image based on the average color at each pixel between the two images.

**Works best if the images are the same size in height and width.
